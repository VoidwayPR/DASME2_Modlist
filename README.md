List of Playable Mods and Patches for the Steam Game "Draw a Stickman Epic 2" released by Hitcents

Current List: Alternate Pencils - Replaces the main 5 pencils with new ones, from Draw a Stickman Epic 1, 3, and completely original ones. These include the Ink Pencil, the Bubble Pencil, the Lake Pencil, the Bomb Pencil, and the Lava Pencil.

Console Commands - Adds an in-game console that allows you to change the game in fun ways, combine other mods, and create challenges for yourself!

Death Warrant - Difficulty Mod which makes enemies, ink, and especially bosses much stronger. Also has music changes.

GunBlast - Replaces the in-game sword with a gun that you can shoot enemies with or shoot individually at point blank.

Ink Lab - Custom Map that allows you to mess with the in-game mechanics. Uses NPCBase.

Ink Mod - Turns you into one of the Ink Creatures. You slide faster in Ink and take damage from trees. Features an alternate ending.

Ink Mod Old - Older version of the Ink Mod that contains some bugs and doesn't have an alternate player effect.

Jump - Adds a Jump Button to the game, with an optional "Fly mode". Useful for checking out glitches and secrets.

Level 9 - Short and Sweet Custom Map, first one ever made. Limited due to the early stages of custom mapping.

Level5PossibleFix - Possible fix to the Level 5 bug on certain PCs that make it impossible to finish the level. Not sure if it entirely works but it should so try it out.

NPCBase - Tool for future mods. Adds more depth to NPCs by enabling their physics, allowing them to take damage, and optionally turn them into ink which reverses the damage that they take.

Vibrant Colors - Replaces the drawing color bar with more vibrant and vivid colors compared to the washed out ones in the original.
